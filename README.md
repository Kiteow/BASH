Under root user run the script (change the permission for execution if needed) with input arguments in order:
./init.sh "Subject" "From(email)" "To(email)" "Also To(email)"
After that all the parameters you enter will be exported to env. variables, so you can change them later.

Script generates logs.txt file and DO_RESPONSE.txt file, DO_RESPONSE file will be deleted.
